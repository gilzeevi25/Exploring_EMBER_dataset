# Exploring EMBER Dataset: Quick summary of our work
![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=gilzeevi25.Exploring_EMBER_dataset.issue.1) <br/>
In this repo and we inspect several methods and models in order to compete with the original [EMBER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04637) dataset and its baseline results.<br>
We do that by presenting a lightweight dataset with only 184 features instead of the original 2381 features.<br>
We inspected several methods for feature selection and dimensionality reduction and then plugged the data into several models , including NN, just to find out that XGBoost outperformed them all.<br>
Notes:
* Engage Ember wraps inside the actions need to be made beforehand in order to start playing around with EMBER dataset.
* We also would like to refer to the author's [repo](https://github.com/elastic/ember).<br>
