# Quick summary of our work
In this repo and we inspect several methods and models in order to compete with the original EMBER dataset and its baseline results.<br>
We do that by presenting a lightweight dataset with only 184 features instead of the original 2381 features.
We inspected several methods for feature selection and dimensionality reduction and then plugged the data into several models , including NN, just to find out that XGBoost outperformed them all.
